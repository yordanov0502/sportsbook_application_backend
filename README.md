This is a repository of my first ever backend API in the Spring eco-system, which I built along with a colleague at the time - Teodor Nikolov. We were guided throughout the whole process (internship program) by 2 mentors - Angel and Martin. The project has Spring Security configured with custom Authentication and JWT filters as well as related Spring Validation, entity management and communication with 3rd party API for extracting sports events information and results. The project was developed between March and May 2023. Since then, I along with my colleague Teodor Nikolov improved a lot.
